{"name":"prideR","tagline":"EMBL-EBI PRIDE Archive R package","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PRIDE-R/prideR.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/PRIDE-R/prideR)\r\n[prideR](https://github.com/PRIDE-R/prideR)\r\n======\r\n\r\nAn [R package](https://github.com/PRIDE-R/prideR) to obtain data from the EMBL-EBI Proteomics Repository Identifications Database ([PRIDE Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) and [PRIDE Cluster](http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/pride/cluster)). It uses its RESTful Web Services at [PRIDE Archive WS](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/) and [PRIDE Cluster WS](http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive) for that purpose.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the following domain entities are supported:  \r\n\r\n* Projects as S4 objects, including methods to get them from PRIDE by accession and `as.data.frame`  \r\n* Assays as S4 objects, including methods to get them from PRIDE by accession and `as.data.frame`  \r\n* Files as S4 objects, including methods to get them from PRIDE by project and assay accession and `as.data.frame`  \r\n* Protein identifications associated with a project, as S4 objects, including methods to get them from PRIDE by project accession and `as.data.frame`  \r\n* PSM identifications associated with a project, as S4 objects, including methods to get them from PRIDE by project accession and `as.data.frame`  \r\n* PRIDE Cluster ClusterSummary, as S4 objects and as `as.data.frame`.  \r\n\r\n### Installation  \r\n\r\nFirst, we need to install `devtools`:  \r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n    library(devtools)\r\n   \r\nThen we just call  \r\n\r\n    install_github(\"PRIDE-R/prideR\")\r\n    library(prideR)\r\n\r\n### Examples  \r\n\r\n#### PRIDE Archive  \r\n\r\nGet project `PXD000001` summary:  \r\n\r\n    get.ProjectSummary(\"PXD000001\")\r\n\r\nSearch for at most 20 projects by term `blood`. The results are returned as a `list` of `ProjectSummary` objects:  \r\n\r\n    search.list.ProjectSummary(\"blood\",20)\r\n\r\nGet them as a `data.frame`:  \r\n\r\n    list.to.data.frame(search.list.ProjectSummary(\"blood\",20))\r\n\r\nGet the first 50 Proteins for project `PXD000001` as a list of `ProteinDetail` objects:  \r\n\r\n    protein.list(list.ProteinDetailList(\"PXD000001\", 0, 50))\r\n\r\nOr as a `data.frame`:  \r\n\r\n    as.data.frame(list.ProteinDetailList(\"PXD000001\",0, 50))\r\n\r\nPlot some counts:  \r\n\r\n    plot(list.ProteinDetailList(\"PXD000001\",0, 50))\r\n\r\nGet 5 PSMs for project `PXD000001` as a list of `PsmDetail` objects:  \r\n\r\n    get.list.PsmDetail(\"PXD000001\", 5)\r\n\r\nThere are also count methods for each of the PRIDE Archive entitites.  \r\n\r\n#### PRIDE Cluster  \r\n\r\nGet page 0 with a size of 20 clusters for peptide sequence *ELISN*:  \r\n\r\n    search.ClusterSearchResults(\"elisn\", 0, 20)\r\n\r\nAs a data frame:  \r\n\r\n    as.data.frame(search.ClusterSearchResults(\"elisn\", 1, 20))\r\n\r\nPlot results:\r\n\r\n    plotresults(search.ClusterSearchResults(\"elisn\", 0, 20))\r\n\r\n### Future Works  \r\n\r\nSome things to be done, sooner than later:  \r\n\r\n- Check mandatory parameters  \r\n- Deal with `SpectrumDetail` entities when available  \r\n\r\n\r\n### About us   \r\n\r\nFind out about us in our GitHub profiles:  \r\n[Jose A.
